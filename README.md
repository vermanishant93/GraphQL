## GraphQL Integration ðŸš€

### ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository contains my learnings about GraphQL, including query building, sorting, filtering, mutations, and real-time subscriptions.

### ðŸ“– Topics Covered

ðŸ”¹ **GraphQL Basics**

   - Understanding GraphQL schema and resolvers.
   - Setting up a GraphQL server.

ðŸ”¹ **Building Queries**

   - Fetching data using GraphQL queries.
   - Multi-threaded queries using Pooled `DbContextFactory`.
   - Optimizing database calls.

ðŸ”¹ **Sorting & Filtering**

   - Implementing sorting on query results.
   - Adding filtering mechanisms to GraphQL queries.

ðŸ”¹ **Building Mutations**

   - Writing mutations to modify data.
   - Handling input types and payload responses.

ðŸ”¹ **Subscriptions** (Real-time updates)

   - Implementing real-time event notifications using WebSockets.
   - Streaming live data updates to clients.

### âš¡ Technologies Used

   - **C# .NET Core** for backend services.
   - **Entity Framework Core** for database interactions.
   - **HotChocolate GraphQL** for GraphQL integration.
   - **WebSockets** for real-time event subscriptions.
   - **SQL Server** for data persistence.
   - **Docker & Kubernetes** for containerization and orchestration.

This project helped me deepen my understanding of GraphQL and its practical applications in modern web development. ðŸš€
